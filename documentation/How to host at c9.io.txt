After creating an account, open your c9.io enviroment, then
open a terminal there and send each of the following lines:

# Step 1 - Installing PyTelegramBotAPI

git clone https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI.git
cd pyTelegramBotAPI
sudo python3 setup.py install

# Step 2 - Downloading parklezbot

git clone https://github.com/leparklez/parklezbot.git

# Step 3 - Writing your token and adding admin:

Open parklezbot/config.py and at the first block, write your token between the ' '
Down below in the same file, admin_users[ your id ] = 'Your name for reference'
(Obviously, save the file.)

# Step 4 - Running with Python 3:

At the top of the page, click at ** RUN > RUN WITH > PYTHON 3.4 **

- You're done! if you're running Python 3 and has set the token correctly, everything should work. -

As free user, you have to restart your bot daily, since every 24h, c9 stops your scripts.
